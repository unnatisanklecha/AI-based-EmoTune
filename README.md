# AI BASED EMOTUNE
Developed an AI-powered web application that recommends music based on facial emotion recognition using MediaPipe, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Streamlit.

The Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System is an innovative project aimed at enhancing user experience by offering personalized music recommendations based on facial emotion recognition. By leveraging advanced machine learning and computer vision technologies, this application provides a seamless and interactive way to align music with the user's current emotional state. 

The system captures the user's facial expressions through a webcam, analyzes these expressions to detect emotions, and recommends music that matches the detected emotions. This not only creates a more engaging and enjoyable music listening experience but also helps in mood regulation and emotional well-being.

## Key Features
+ Emotion Detection: Analyzes facial expressions to determine user emotions.
+ Music Recommendation: Suggests music tracks matching the detected emotions.
+ Web Interface: Interactive web application for capturing webcam feed and displaying music recommendations.

## Technologies Used
+ Python: Primary programming language for backend and machine learning.
+ MediaPipe: Used for facial emotion recognition.
+ TensorFlow and Keras: Frameworks for building and training the emotion detection model.
+ OpenCV: Used for image processing and video capture.
+ Streamlit: Framework for creating the web application.
+ Streamlit-webrtc: Module for capturing webcam feed in the browser.
